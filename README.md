`$lein run generate 'filename' key-size` to create a new keypair with name 'filename'.

`$lein run encrypt 'keyfile' 'message` to encrypt a message 'message' with the public key from 'keyfile'.

`$lein run decrypt 'keyfile 'cypher'` to decrypt a cypher 'cypher' with the secret key form 'keyfile'.

`$lein run help` to display the possible commands.
